Gene-dropping of sequence variants within pedigrees

Brief description of the files:
* *cm_length.txt* contains the length of each chromosome in centiMorgans.  A genetic distance of 1 Morgan represents the expected number of crossovers between two markers.
* *run.sh* is an example Bash script for the entire process.
